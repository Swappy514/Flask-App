`SQLAlchemy` is widely used in web applications and other Python projects that require database interaction.

`ORM` stands for Object-Relational Mapping,
which is a programming technique used to convert data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages.

`sqlalchemy` in easy_words means a tool that helps developers work with databases using Python code instead of writing SQL queries directly.
