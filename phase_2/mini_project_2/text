In this a HTML code is connected with flask and made a blog page
In this learn what is jinja2, template inheritance

so, without inheritance we need to write on each_pages the "Header" & "Footer" again and again
but with the help of inheritance we write the code once and inherit the property again & again

template_inheritance
we make a base.html file in that write a base_code once and can we used in every code/page, if we need to change anythink then we will only change in base_code then automatically the other pages will get upadted.

base_code
{% block content %} {% endblock %}

and to fetch this file in other files use
{% extends "base.html" %}

this file will extract the base_code file to the current file so no need to rewrite the same content again
